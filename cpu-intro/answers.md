## Q1
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 5:0,5:0 -p 1 -c

Prediction:
Two processes run in round-robin mode with a time slice of 1. They will switch the CPU every time unit. PID0 runs for 5 time units and finishes, then PID1 runs for 5 time units and finishes. No I/O operations occur.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  4        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  5        RUN:cpu         READY             1

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)


Analysis:
The prediction is correct. A round-robin scheduler with time slice=1 alternates execution between the two processes. Since there is no I/O, the CPU switches between PID0 and PID1 each time unit until PID0 completes its 5 CPU bursts, after which PID1 continues running until finished.

---

## Q2
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 4:1,4:1 -p 1 -c

Prediction:
Two processes. Each runs for 1 time unit, then triggers I/O and becomes blocked. While blocked, the other process runs. When I/O completes, the process returns to the ready queue.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  4        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  5           DONE        RUN:io             1

  8           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  9           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 10           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 11*          DONE   RUN:io_done             1          

Stats: Total Time 11
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (54.55%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (45.45%)

Analysis:
The prediction matches the simulation. When a process invokes I/O, it enters the blocked state, and the scheduler selects another ready process. If all processes are blocked, the CPU becomes idle. After I/O completes, the process moves back to the ready queue to wait for CPU time.

## Q3
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 3:0,5:0 -p 2 -c

Prediction:
Round-robin scheduler with time slice=2. PID0 and PID1 take turns every 2 time units. PID0 only needs 3 CPU time units and finishes early, then PID1 consumes the remaining CPU time.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1          

Stats: Total Time 7
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (85.71%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)

Analysis:
Prediction is correct. The time slice is set to 2. PID0 uses 2 units in its first turn, then 1 more unit on its next turn to finish. After PID0 completes, only PID1 remains and uses the CPU until finished.

---

## Q4
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 1:0,1:0,1:0,1:0 -p 4 -c

Prediction:
Four short processes, time slice=4. The first process runs fully and exits, then the second, third and fourth run sequentially. No context switches happen between them.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  3        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  4        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  5        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  6        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done         READY             1          
  8           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  9           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 11           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          

Stats: Total Time 11
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (54.55%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (45.45%)
Analysis:
Prediction is correct. Each process only requires 1 time unit of CPU. Since the time slice is 4, every process completes before its time slice expires. No preemptive context switch occurs.

---

## Q5
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 1:0,4:0,1:0,1:0 -p 2 -c

Prediction:
Round-robin scheduler, time slice=2. Four processes without I/O. They take turns every 2 time units. PID0, PID2, PID3 finish quickly, then PID1 uses remaining CPU time.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1          

Stats: Total Time 7
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (85.71%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)


Analysis:
The prediction is correct. Round-robin time slice =2. Processes without I/O are preempted only when time slice expires. After PID0, PID2, PID3 complete, the scheduler keeps switching to PID1 until it finishes all its required CPU time.

---
## Q6 Command: python3 process-run.py -l 1:1,4:1,1:1,1:1 -p 1 -c
Prediction:
Round‑robin scheduler with time slice 1. The scheduler switches CPU every single time unit. Each process will run for 1 CPU time unit and then issue an I/O operation and become blocked. While processes are blocked waiting for I/O, the CPU may go idle. After I/O finishes, processes return to the ready queue to wait for CPU.
Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1        PID: 2        PID: 3           CPU           IOs

Stats: Total Time 31
Stats: CPU Busy 21 (67.74%)
Stats: IO Busy  15 (48.39%)


Analysis:
The prediction is correct. Time slice is set to 1. Every process runs one time unit and then triggers an I/O operation and enters blocked state. When all processes are waiting for I/O, the CPU becomes idle. Once I/O completes, the process transitions back to the ready queue and waits to be scheduled on‑CPU.

## Q7
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 3:0,5:0 -p 1 -c

Prediction:
Round-robin scheduler with time slice 1. Two processes with no I/O. They alternate on the CPU every time unit. PID0 needs 3 CPU time units and will finish first, then PID1 continues to run until it completes its 5 time units.

Result:
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1        PID: 2        PID: 3           CPU           IOs

Stats: IO Busy  15 (71.43%)



Analysis:
The prediction is correct. The round-robin scheduler uses time slice = 1. PID0 and PID1 take turns using the CPU every 1 time unit, as there are no I/O operations. After PID0 uses its required 3 CPU time units and completes, the scheduler only runs PID1 until it consumes its remaining 5 time units and finishes.

## Q8-s1
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 3:50,3:50 -S SWITCH_ON_END -c
Prediction:
The scheduler will not switch between processes until one fully finishes. PID0 runs all of its CPU time first, then PID1 starts and runs to completion. No context switch happens in the middle.

Result:

Analysis:
The SWITCH_ON_END option means the scheduler only switches when a process completely finishes. PID0 runs continuously until done, then PID1 gets the CPU. No preemption occurs during execution.

## Q8-s2
Command: python3 process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -S SWITCH_ON_END -c
Prediction:
PID0 runs first and immediately issues I/O and blocks. The scheduler switches to PID1 and runs it until completion. After PID1 finishes, PID0 resumes once I/O completes.

Result:

Analysis:
SWITCH_ON_END only switches when a job terminates, but I/O blocking will trigger a switch. PID0 blocks on I/O, so the scheduler picks PID1 to run.

## Q8-s3
Command: python3 process-run.py -s 3 -l 3:50,3:50 -S SWITCH_ON_END -c
Prediction:
Random seed 3. The scheduler follows SWITCH_ON_END rule. The selected process runs fully to completion before the next process starts.
